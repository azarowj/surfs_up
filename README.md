# surfs_up

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to determine weather patterns on the island of Oahu. Specifically, we want to determine if opening a surf and ice cream shop would be sustainable year-round based on these weather patterns. In this particular analysis, we looked at the weather patterns in June and December.


## Results
Here is an image of the summary statistics for June: (https://github.com/azarowj/surfs_up/blob/main/JuneStatistics.png)

Here is an image of the summary statistics for December: (https://github.com/azarowj/surfs_up/blob/main/DecemberStatistics.png)

Below are differences between the weather in June and December on Oahu:
- The minimum temperature in June is 64 degrees whereas the minimum temperature in December is 56 degrees.
- The first quartile for June is 73 degrees while the first quartile for December is 69 degrees.
- The standard deviation for June is approximately 3.26 and the standard deviation for December is approximately 3.75


## Summary
We can see from these results that there is less temperature variation in June than there is in December. While the maximum temperatures are fairly similar, the minimum temperature in December is significantly lower in December. In addtion to the queries already performed, I would also query the precipitation for June and December. I would want to query both the temperature and precipitation by week for each month to get a better idea of the weather patterns over the course of each month as they are both on the cusp of a season change.
